Application use by location, sport and evaluation type
# This repository consists of the raw data from January and February 2022 for use of the software by location (state and country), sport (soccer, hockey, lacrosse, volleyball, baseball, softball, basketball and football) and evaluation type (tryouts or coach assessment).
# For early versions of this data cleaning, Google Sheets is used to eliminate multiple Evaluator IDs using software on each day. SQL likely to be used in the future as data source becomes too large.
